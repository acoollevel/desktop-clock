# ðŸ•“ Desktop Clock
*A clock widget for your desktop!*

Written in Python using the Tk GUI toolkit. The clock displays the current system time and date, with customization options coming soon. Because the window only refreshes once every second, CPU and battery impact are minimal.

## Installing on Windows

NOTE: You will need to have Python 3 installed and `pythonw` must be added to your PATH.

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open `run.bat` to see the clock appear.
3. If it's working fine, right-click `run.bat` and select 'Create shortcut'.
4. Move the shortcut into the startup folder (`C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`).
5. Done! The clock will now appear anytime you start your computer.

If you would like to close the program, click on the clock and hold the escape key for 1 second.
